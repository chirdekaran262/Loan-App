# Loan Eligibility Prediction

## Overview  
This project predicts loan eligibility for applicants using machine learning. It includes a clean and intuitive frontend built with **HTML** and **CSS** to allow users to input applicant details and get instant predictions. The system is designed to make loan approval processes faster and more efficient.

## Features  
- **Backend**: Machine learning model trained to predict loan eligibility.  
- **Frontend**: User-friendly interface for inputting data and displaying results.  
- **Deployment**: End-to-end application ready for real-world use.

## Frontend Summary  
The frontend for the **Loan Eligibility Prediction** project provides a user-friendly interface for inputting loan applicant details and viewing prediction results. This interface focuses on accessibility, clarity, and responsiveness to ensure seamless interaction.

### Key Features:
1. **Interactive Form:**
   - Input fields for all necessary details (e.g., income, loan amount, credit history).
   - Dropdowns and radio buttons for categorical data like gender and education.
   - Real-time form validation with clear error messages.

2. **Responsive Design:**
   - Built with CSS media queries to ensure compatibility with desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
   - A clean layout that adapts to various screen sizes.

3. **Results Display:**
   - Dynamic result section that shows predictions such as "Loan Approved" or "Loan Denied."
   - Optional confidence scores or tips for improving eligibility.

### Technology Stack:
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the web page, including forms and content organization.
- **CSS**: Styling for visual appeal, responsive layouts, and smooth transitions.

### Sample User Workflow:
1. **Fill the Form:**
   Users input details like income, loan amount, and credit history into a structured form.
2. **Submit for Prediction:**
   After submitting, the backend processes the data and sends the result to the frontend.
3. **View Prediction:**
   The prediction result is displayed on the same page without needing a refresh.

### Future Enhancements:
- Add **JavaScript** for dynamic features like live validation or enhanced interactivity.
- Incorporate **data visualizations** to show insights about the prediction.
- Style improvements using frameworks like **Bootstrap** or **Tailwind CSS** for quicker development.

## Dataset  
The dataset includes features such as:  
- **ApplicantIncome**: Income of the applicant.  
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Income of the co-applicant.  
- **LoanAmount**: Loan amount requested.  
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Loan repayment term (in months).  
- **Credit_History**: Credit history of the applicant.  
- **Gender**, **Married**, **Dependents**, **Education**, **Self_Employed**: Demographic and personal details.  
- **Property_Area**: Urban, semi-urban, or rural area of the property.  
- **Loan_Status**: Target variable indicating loan approval (Yes/No).  

## Requirements  
Install the required libraries before running the project:  
```bash

## Getting Started  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/Loan-Eligibility-Prediction.git
   cd Loan-Eligibility-Prediction
   ```  

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

3. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```  

4. Access the web app in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.  

## Machine Learning Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze feature distributions and correlations.  
3. **Model Training**: Train and test multiple algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest).  
4. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to select the best model.  
5. **Deployment**: Integrate the model with the Flask app for predictions.  

## Results  
The best-performing model achieved:  
- **Accuracy**: 85%  
- **Precision**: 88%  
- **Recall**: 82%  

## Future Improvements  
- Add more dynamic visualizations to the frontend for better insights.  
- Integrate advanced algorithms for improved predictions.  
- Expand the app's scope for handling more financial services.
